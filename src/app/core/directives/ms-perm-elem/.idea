/*
	> directive should be an attribute that will take in arguments such as current context,
		e.g. <button id="copyInvoiceItem" ms-perm-elem contextref="invoice" contextfunc="copy"></button>
	
	1 > Create the permission element directive. (This will restrict users from accessing states from UI cues, such as button's links etc.)

	2 > Create a provider for the directive, where the initial permision matrix is established.

	3 > Create mechanism for developers to follow where permissions are resloved before the route is ececuted. (i.e :- invoice copy state resolves the permission to given user, before the route is executed.)
